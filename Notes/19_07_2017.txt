E I network of leak itegrating fire neural network

1. Two groups of neurons E(100) and I(25)

2. Connectivity is as follows.
    -> E neurons are connected to themselves with a probablity 10%
    -> E neruons are connected to I neurons with a probability of 10%
    -> I neurons are connected to E neurons with 15%
    
3. Different synapse types
    -> E to E synapse types are going to be type Ampa
    -> E to I synapse types are going to be type Ampa
    -> I to E synapse types are going to be type Gaba
    
4. The equation for E and I are as follows
    v' = dv/dt = gl*(ve-v) + dc
    
5. firing_threshold = -50, firing_reset = -65, gl~N(2*10^-3, (10^-4)^2), dc~N(0.1, (0.1)^2), ve~N(-65, 2^2)

6. E to E Ampa connection weights ~ N(0.1, 0.05^2)

7. I to E Gaba connection weights ~ N(0.1, 0.05^2)

8. Ampa synapse calculation Is = gs * w * (vs - v)
    gs = exp((ts-t)/tau)
    tau = 100
    ts = firing time step
    w -> weights
    vs = 0
    
9. Gabba synapse calculation Is = gs * w * (vs - v)
    gs = exp((ts-t)/tau)
    tau = 100
    ts = firing time step
    w -> weights
    vs = -90
