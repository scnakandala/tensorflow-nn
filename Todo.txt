1. Abstracting out the current functions -> Supun
2. Have an array for parameters for currents specific for each neuron -> Supun
3. Get the cuda generated by the Tensorflow runtime -> Supun
4. Get the synapse to work -> Giri & Supun
5. Fix the fINaK function -> Giri
6. Do a benchmark for the running times for different number of neurons -> Supun (100,000 iterations with million neurons)
7. Getting the computation graph for HH_neurons_4 -> Supun
8. CPP code benchmark -> Giri
9. Remembering the input value indices instead of connection map multiplication

10. Find what is the exact reason why TensorFlow is failing with large number of neurons.



Grand Goals
===========
1. Creating a gateway (JupyterHub version of this).
2. Optimize the performance and compare it against existing tools.
